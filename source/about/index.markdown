Hello! My name is David Kline. I'm a mechanical engineer living in Ann Arbor, MI.
I received my bachelor's degree from Texas A&M University in College Station, TX in May
2013 and am currently a graduate student at the University of Michigan.

I'm highly interested in automobile design, but also dabble in music, writing,
animation, photography and programming. I spend a lot of time thinking about things that
really don't matter all that much.

What about you?
