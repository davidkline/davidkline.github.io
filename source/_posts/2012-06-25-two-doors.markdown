Overdrawn. Laid off. Looking for anything for the time being. Hourly. Streaks of street lights, halogen, as money leaves the tail pipe and eyelids droop down. Back home.

The alarm clock doesn’t need to be alarming. It can display the time. It doesn’t need to remind anyone of anything.

Phone ringing. Maybe he should have gotten up earlier. Stumbling over cans on the way to the bathroom, phone pinched to his shoulder.


Can I come in today? Yeah, yeah, I can make it.

Fucking ties. The fabric things. Ones you wear on necks.

Driving surface streets now: traffic lights. Water temperature a little hot.

Didn’t know where to park.

Finally inside. Two sets of doors. Air curtain. Nice place. Leased.

Too much experience--why are you here?

Didn’t matter. They’d call.

Back outside, through the two doors. Looking for his car, has two doors.

Found it. Couldn’t chirp the horn. Not keyless.

Driving back, surface streets, the loop, outside the perimeter.

Shitty rented place.

Squalor.
