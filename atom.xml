    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Overdrawn. Laid off. Looking for anything for the time being. Hourly. Streaks of street lights, halogen, as money leaves the tail pipe and eyelids droop down. Back home.</p>

<p>The alarm clock doesn’t need to be alarming. It can display the time. It doesn’t need to remind anyone of anything.</p>

<p>Phone ringing. Maybe he should have gotten up earlier. Stumbling over cans on the way to the bathroom, phone pinched to his shoulder.</p>

<p>Can I come in today? Yeah, yeah, I can make it.</p>

<p>Fucking ties. The fabric things. Ones you wear on necks.</p>

<p>Driving surface streets now: traffic lights. Water temperature a little hot.</p>

<p>Didn’t know where to park.</p>

<p>Finally inside. Two sets of doors. Air curtain. Nice place. Leased.</p>

<p>Too much experience&mdash;why are you here?</p>

<p>Didn’t matter. They’d call.</p>

<p>Back outside, through the two doors. Looking for his car, has two doors.</p>

<p>Found it. Couldn’t chirp the horn. Not keyless.</p>

<p>Driving back, surface streets, the loop, outside the perimeter.</p>

<p>Shitty rented place.</p>

<p>Squalor.</p>
